Python \u00b6 RSSerpent is written in the Python programming language. You must have a valid Python installation on your system in order to get RSSerpent up & run. The most universal way to install Python is to grab a installer from the official Python download page . An alternative approach is to install via a package manager: Linux macOS Windows # Arch sudo pacman -S python # Debian/Ubuntu sudo apt update sudo apt install python3 python3-pip # Homebrew brew install python # MacPorts sudo port selfupdate sudo port install python # Chocolatey choco install python # Scoop scoop install python Note If you need to manage multiple versions of Python on your system, checkout pyenv . Warning Currently RSSerpent does not support Python 3.10. After successful installation, you need to run python -V (or python3 -V ) to verify the currently installed Python's version, as the default Python version provided by some package managers might not be compatible with RSSerpent. Please refer to the documentation of respective package manager to install a compatible Python version. Note Make sure you have git installed too.

In your terminal, start a new session and run: cookiecutter gh:rsserpent/template This will download the official RSSerpent plugin template from GitHub. You will then be prompted to fill in some information: plugin [rsserpent-plugin-xxx]: description [An rsserpent plugin for xxx.]: username [queensferryme]: link [https://github.com/queensferryme]: email [queensferryme@example.com]: The message between the brackets [...] are default values for respective fields, you may press Enter to accept or type in your own choice. You personal information ( email etc.) will only be used for rendering the template. You could always remain anonymous if you'd like to. After that, we'll automatically create a directory rsserpent-plugin-xxx/ with all the necessary project configurations for you. We will also install project dependencies (through poetry ) and pre-commit hooks, which may take minutes depending on your network connection. Develop \u00b6 You will need a IDE to start developing. We recommend using Visual Studio Code , or VSCode for short. Use VSCode to open the directory you just created using cookiecutter . You may be prompted to install some recommended VSCode plugins. An RSSerpent plugin is mostly a collection of routers , and each router is a path string accompanied by a data provider function. from typing import Any , Dict path = \"/path/to/route\" async def provider () -> Dict [ str , Any ]: return { \"title\" : \"Example\" , \"link\" : \"https://example.com\" , \"description\" : \"An example rsserpent plugin.\" , \"items\" : [{ \"title\" : \"Example Title\" , \"description\" : \"Example Description\" }], } Note See more example routers here . Warning The provider function must be async and can not have position-only arguments . The path variable defines an endpoint where users could access the RSS feed, and the provider function provides necessary data for rendering and serving the RSS feed to users. You will also need to register you routers in rsserpent_plugin_xxx/__init__.py : from . import route1 , route2 , route3 plugin = Plugin ( # ... routers = { route1 . path : route1 . provider , route2 . path : route2 . provider , route3 . path : route3 . provider , }, ) Note Poetry install dependencies inside a virtualenv . Therefore, in order to use tools like pre-commit , pytest or uvicorn , you will need to run poetry shell or source $(poetry env info -p)/bin/activate to activate the virtual environment. Run uvicorn --reload rsserpent:app in your terminal to start an RSSerpent instance locally, so that you can see if you plugin works as expected. \u279c uvicorn --reload rsserpent:app INFO: Will watch for changes in these directories: ['/path/to/your/directory'] INFO: Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit) INFO: Started reloader process [30920] using statreload INFO: Started server process [30922] INFO: Waiting for application startup.

Write your tests in the tests/ directory and run pytest to run the tests. Publish \u00b6 After you made enough changes to the plugin locally, make sure to commit your changes and push to GitHub. In this way, you can make you latest work available to plugin users. git add --all git commit -m \"<type>: <description>\" git push origin Note Commit messages should be in accordance with the Conventional Commits specification.
